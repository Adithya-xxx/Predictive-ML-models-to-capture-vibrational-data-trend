<h1>Building a predictive ML model that predicts/captures vibtrational frequency vs intensity trends</h1>

Given two data-sets, vibrational_data which contains molecule names and corresponding frequencies and intensities for its different vibrational modes, and molecular coordinates which contains molecule name, atomic coordinates and other features like Dipole moment,point group and dominant atom

<h3>Test code vibrational_prediction.py</h3>
Upon running the code output is presented in a line graph format which compares actual vs predicted molecules Vibrational IR datapoints

<h3>Test code reverse_prediction.py</h3>
Upon running the code, we can see a picture of a predicted molecule and print its coordinates for a given test case(which takes an input of vibrational_data + other features).
